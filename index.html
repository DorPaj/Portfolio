				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Hello. Computer science is my passion and I live in Poland. I am a Roblox developer and I am a front end web developer (do not confuse with Roblox web developer). I have been developing games since 2020 and I have been making websites since 2022. I specialize in:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Scripting Roblox games on client side and server side,</li>
					<li>Designing graphical user interfaces for Roblox games,</li>
					<li>Making websites by using client-sided web technologies.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>On this website you can find more information about me. Hopefully this website will help you decide whether you want to work with me. Enjoy your stay!</p>

				<h2>Wool War: Roblox Edition</h2>
				<p>The inspiration for this game was my Minecraft world. I made something like my Minecraft world but on Roblox and I added more stuff to it. In this game, players in their worlds can talk, fight, place blocks and destroy blocks. Users do not have to worry about losing their progress - all worlds are being saved, and leaderboards keep track of what players do. This project shows that:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I understand how to script games made of multiple places,</li>
					<li>I can make reserved servers system and do other things related to <a href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/TeleportService" target="_blank">TeleportService</a>,</li>
					<li>I am able to make building system,</li>
					<li>I understand how to make customization system,</li>
					<li>I can script game passes and developers products to monetize a game,</li>
					<li>I am able to script user interface navigation.</li>
					<li>I understand how to make a normal data store system and a ordered data store system</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Click <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/6716740873/Wool-War-Roblox-Edition-OPEN-BETA" target="_blank">here</a> to play this game.</li>

				<h2>Blocks Placement System to Grid Remastered</h2>
				<p>This is my open-source project. This system is like placing blocks in the game "Wool War: Roblox Edition" but I added new things to it. The main thing is determining if a building tool in this project can place floating blocks. I described in detail what it is in <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/blocks-placement-system-to-grid-remastered/2276437" target="_blank">this</a> Roblox Devforum post. <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/12978981893/Blocks-Placement-System-to-Grid-Remastered" target="_blank">Here</a> is the actual game but this link can be also found in the post mentioned earlier. This project shows that:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I can use recursion to solve difficult programming problems (in this case checking if a specific block is floating),</li>
					<li>I am able to make systems easy to customize in Roblox Studio with no coding skills (using attributes and other ways of doing that),</li>
					<li>I understand how to talk to other developers, which can be seen in the post mentioned above.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Super Tic Tac Toe</h2>
				<p>This is my newest solo project (mainly made by me). In this game players can play the iconic Tic Tac Toe but expanded and with extra rules. It makes the gameplay interesting. This projects shows that:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I can fix complex coding bugs and glitches by debugging scripts,</li>
					<li>I am able to make ranked matchmaking and custom matchmaking.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Website development</h2>
				<p>As I said Roblox scripting and GUI designing are not only two of my skills. I also can make websites. I can use the following web technologies to make a static website:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>HTML (the core of a website),</li>
					<li>CSS (the look of a website),</li>
					<li>JavaScript (the muscles of a website).</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I host websites made by me on the <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> platform but if you give me a different hosting website to use, I can host it here. Additionally if you provide me a way of making a dynamic hosting, I can use the static web technologies plus these dynamic technologies:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>MySQL (talk to a database system),</li>
					<li>PHP (answer with information obtained from a database, for example sign in system).</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This website is also a part of my portfolio. It has a special support for mobile devices. Go ahead and see that. I also have an another website and it is about photos, which I took by using my drone. Click <a href="https://dorianekbsp.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a> to see more of my web development work. You can talk to me to decide how the link to the website should look like (with addition of ".github.io" at the end"). Alternatively you can use something different to host a website instead of relying on me.</p>

				<p>That is all what I wanted to show you. Let me know if there are mistakes on this website. Obviously I can do more than I showed. Here are my social links so you can talk to me:</p>
